# To-Do Learning Journey 📝

This repository documents my personal journey building a full-featured To-Do List app from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🌱 Day 1
- Basic HTML structure (input, button, ul)
- JS DOM manipulation (add task)
- Dark Mode toggle using classList

## 🚀 Day 2
- Added `select` inputs for priority and category
- Added datetime picker
- Created task object with full metadata
- Dynamically built list item including category and due date
