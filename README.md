To-Do Learning Journey 📝
This repository documents my personal journey building a full-featured To-Do List app from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

🌱 Day 1
Built the basic HTML structure (input, button, ul)

Added JavaScript for adding tasks dynamically

Implemented Dark Mode toggle using classList.toggle

🚀 Day 2
Added select inputs for Priority and Category

Added datetime picker input

Created task object with full metadata

Dynamically built list items with Priority, Category, and Time

Styled inputs and buttons with CSS (hover, focus, transition effects)

✅ Final Version
Added Delete Task functionality (🗑️ button)

Added Mark as Done functionality (✔️ button with line-through and opacity)

Used localStorage to persist tasks after page reload

Code refactored into small, reusable functions (Clean Code principles)

Dark Mode switch maintained

Project pushed to GitHub as a complete learning project
